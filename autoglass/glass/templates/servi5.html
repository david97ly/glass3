			 Extensive damage to your windshield glass can make for one scary ride. Instead of acting as a protective barrier between you, your passengers, and any incoming debris, a defective windshield actually provides little more than a precarious shell that can shatter and collapse at any given moment. As if driving around one of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas isn’t dangerous enough, a weakened front windshield can also impede your visibility, making it more difficult and perilous than ever to get from place to place. While minor windshield chips can be filled in with epoxy and sealed off tight, longer cracks and deep gouges are often well beyond the boundaries of simple repair.
