			It can happen in the blink of an eye. Just one flying rock, stray golf ball, or other unfortunate incident can leave you with a deep ding or jagged crack in your vehicle’s windshield.

Aside from the peace of mind you derive from a reliable vehicle, you have plenty of other reasons to seek prompt windshield repairs, including:
</p><p class="lead"><b>
Safety—A</b> tiny crack or chip may seem harmless enough, but even the most minimal windshield damages can be dangerous. A weakened piece of glass could increase the likelihood of a serious cave-in in the event of a crash. Cracks also increase the likelihood of being hurt by flying glass in an accident.
<p class="lead"><b>Passed Inspections—New York</b> has laws regarding cracked and chipped windshields. If you have a serious crack, especially one within the area covered by your windshield wipers, you should seek windshield crack repair immediately. Doing this will make it much more likely that your car will pass inspection.</p>
<p class="lead">
<b>Citation Prevention—A</b> damaged windshield may lead a law enforcement officer to issue you a ticket for operating an unsafe vehicle. Avoid this hassle by having your chipped or cracked windshield repaired. 
In addition to all of these considerations, it’s important to remember that most insurance companies will not only cover the cost of your windshield glass repair in full, but they’ll also waive the deductible. Plus, Master Auto Glass Corp. will handle all of the tedious paperwork for you and work directly with your insurance company on behalf of your claims. </p>
<p class="lead">
